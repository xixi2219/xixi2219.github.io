**Title**:Superfluid Current across a barrier in a Ring Lattice

**Advisor**: Prof. Yongyong Cai

We consider the current of the stationary points of an energy functional for a Bose-Einstein condensate(BEC) on an ideal ring with $N$ sites. 
Suppose we ramp up a barrier at site $1$, that is, the trapping potential $V_{j}$ in this discrete model will be non-zero only at $V_{1}$.
The energy functional is deformed and the stationary points will shift. We use numerical algorithm to explore how would the super-current change in this process. 
Here we take the periodic boundary condition.

We firstly use Numerical continuation method(a kind of Newton method to some extent) to trace the stationary points when we increase $V_{1}$ and also the repulsive parameter $g$. 
We find that the current will eventually vanish when $V_{1}$ is large enough. And the solution's behavior will be different at different $g$. 
We are now trying to do some theoretical analysis about the phenomenon we find. 

We also pay attention to the linear stability and dynamics of this system.
