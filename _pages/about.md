I'm a second-year M.S. student at [School of Mathematical science](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/)ï¼Œ[Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Cai Yongyong](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/219441.htm). 
My reasearch includes numerical PDE, numerical analysis, and computational physics. I am also very interested in machine learning, optimization and other fields related to applied mathematics. I have earned B.A.s in mathematics and applied mathematics at Beijing Normal University in 2022.

# Research and Project Experience
## Superfluid Current across a barrier in a Ring Lattice
*Advisor: Prof. Cai Yongyong*

We explore the properties of the current of stationary points of the following energy functionl for a Bose-Einstein condensate(BEC) on an ideal ring with $N$ sites:
$$E(\phi)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left[-(\bar{\phi_{j}}\phi_{j+1}+\bar{\phi_{j+1}}\phi_{j})+\frac{1}{2}g|\phi_{j}|^{4}\right]+V|\phi_{1}|^{2}.$$
Here we take the periodic boundary condition $\phi_{1}=\phi_{N+1}$, and the constraint is:
$$\sum_{j=1}^{N}|\phi_{j}|^{2}=1.$$
Suppose we ramp up a barrier at site 1, that is, the trapping potential $V_{j}$ in this discrete model will be non-zero only at $V_{1}$. The energy functional is deformed and the stationary points will shift. We use numerical algorithm to explore how would the super-current change in this process. 

We firstly use Numerical continuation method(a kind of Newton method to some extent) to trace the stationary points when we increase $V_{1}$ and also the repulsive parameter $g$. We find that the current will eventually vanish when $V_{1}$ is large enough. And the solution's behavior will be different at relatively large $g$. We are now trying to do some theoretical analysis about the phenomenon we find. 

We also pay attention to the linear stability and dynamics of this system.
