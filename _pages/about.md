I'm a second-year M.S. student at [School of Mathematical science](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/)ï¼Œ[Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Yongyong Cai](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/219441.htm). 

My reasearch includes numerical PDE, numerical analysis, and computational physics. I am also very interested in machine learning, optimization and other fields related to applied mathematics. I have earned B.A.s in mathematics and applied mathematics at Beijing Normal University in 2022.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae].For more information, please navigate to any of the following pages: [Reasearch], [Projects], [Teaching], [Talks] and [Interests]
