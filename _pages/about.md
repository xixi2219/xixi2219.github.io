I'm a second-year M.S. student at the [School of Mathematical Science](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Yongyong Cai](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/219441.htm). 

My research includes numerical PDE, numerical analysis, and computational physics. I am also very interested in machine learning, optimization, and other fields related to applied mathematics. I earned a B.A.s in mathematics and applied mathematics at Beijing Normal University in 2022.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/xixi2219/xixi2219.github.io/blob/master/assets/Kuang%20Yutong-%20CV.pdf).
