I'm a second-year graduate student from [School of Mathematical science](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/)ï¼Œ[Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). I major in computational mathematics and am advised by [Prof. Cai Yongyong](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/219441.htm). 

My reasearch includes numerical PDE, numerical analysis, and computational physics. I am also very interested in machine learning, optimization and other fields related to applied mathematics. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae].

## Superfluid Current across a barrier in a Ring Lattice
*Advisor: Prof. Cai Yongyong*

We consider the current of the stationary points of an energy functional for a Bose-Einstein condensate(BEC) on an ideal ring with $N$ sites. Suppose we ramp up a barrier at site 1, that is, the trapping potential $V_{j}$ in this discrete model will be non-zero only at $V_{1}$. The energy functional is deformed and the stationary points will shift. We use numerical algorithm to explore how would the super-current change in this process. 

We firstly use Numerical continuation method(a kind of Newton method to some extent) to trace the stationary points when we increase $V_{1}$ and also the repulsive parameter $g$. We find that the current will eventually vanish when $V_{1}$ is large enough. And the solution's behavior will be different at relatively large $g$. We are now trying to do some theoretical analysis about the phenomenon we find. 

We also pay attention to the linear stability and dynamics of this system.
