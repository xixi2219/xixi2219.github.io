I'm a second-year graduate student from [School of Mathematical science](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/)ï¼Œ[Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). I major in computational mathematics and am advised by [Prof. Cai Yongyong](https://math.bnu.edu.cn/jzg/szdw/ac/219441.htm). 

My reasearch includes numerical solution of PDE, numerical analysis, and computational physics. I am also very interested in machine learning, optimization and other fields related to applied mathematics. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae].
