## Project Experience
**Title**: [Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equation(Course Project)](https://github.com/xixi2219/Numerical-Solution-of-PDE)

- Developed a MATLAB program for the five-point difference scheme and conducted error analysis for solving
the Poisson equation. Authored an accompanying experimental report using LaTeX.
- Created MATLAB programs for Explicit, Implicit, and Crank-Nicolson schemes to address modeling problems in parabolic equations, including error analysis. Documented the findings in an experimental report with LaTeX.
- Programmed in MATLAB for Upwind, Lax-Wendroff, and Beam-Warming schemes for hyperbolic equations and their error analysis. The results were reported using LaTeX.
- Composed MATLAB programs for various numerical methods to solve systems of linear equations and the multigrid method. Presented a comparative analysis of these methods.
