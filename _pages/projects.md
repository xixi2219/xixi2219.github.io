## Project Experience
**Title**:Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equation(Course Project)

- Wrote MATLAB programs for the five-point difference scheme and its error analysis for solving Poisson equation. 
- Wrote MATLAB programs for the Explicit scheme, Implicit scheme, and Crank-Nicolson scheme for solving modeling problems of parabolic equations and their error analysis.
- Wrote MATLAB programs for the Upwind scheme, Lax-Wendroff scheme, and Beam-Warming scheme for solving hyperbolic equations and their error analysis.
- Wrote MATLAB programs for different numerical methods for solving systems of linear equations and multigrid method, and made a presentation for the compare of different methods.


## Working Experience
**Company**:Chongqing Xianshi Investment Management Co., Ltd

**Department**:Quantitative Strategy Department 

During the internship, I gained insights into the financial industry and quantitative investment. 
I actively communicated with team members on trading strategies and learned how to build a quantitative framework, 
as well as how to replicate and backtest strategies. Throughout the internship, I successfully completed the coding 
and backtesting of a trading strategy based on transaction volume, and replicated several other strategies. The code was completed by python.
